 * The catch2 framework main function is compiled by this source file into
 * tests-main.o.  This is mainly so that the framework needs to be only compiled
 * 1 time normally.  The framework can take a significant amount of time to compile.
 * Thus it is useful to avoid this recompilation during normal build/test
 * iterations.
